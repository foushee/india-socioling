\section{Likert}
%Link between language and religious/ethnic identity
Children additionally responded to a set of Likert-style items adapting and extending classic essentialism probes  (e.g., ``It is easier to learn a language that was spoken by your ancestors than a language that was not spoken by your ancestors, even if no one in your family currently speaks it;'' see, \cite{gelman2007developmental}; \cite{byers2015bilingualism}; \cite{gelman1999biological}). We also measured children's agreement with more general statements about what can be assumed about a person from the languages they speak (e.g., ``You can tell how much education someone has had by the language(s) they speak.''). Children responded on a 7-point scale from \textit{Strongly Disagree} to \textit{Strongly Agree}, and justified their responses (these open-ended responses are not analyzed here).
